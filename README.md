# Detecting-Fake-News-with-SVM-Multinomial-Na-ve-Bayes-and-Passive-Aggressive-Classifier
In this project, my team wanted to find out which algorithm has the best speed and accuracy in detecting fake news. We compared 3 algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, and Passive-Aggressive Classifier. This project was codded using Google Colab with python.
