# Detecting Fake News with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, and Passive Aggressive Classifier
In this project, my team wanted to find out which algorithm has the best speed and accuracy in detecting fake news. We compared 3 algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, and Passive-Aggressive Classifier. This project was codded using Google Colab with python.
